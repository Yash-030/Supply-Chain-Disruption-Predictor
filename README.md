# AI-Driven Supply Chain Disruption Predictor and Inventory Optimization System

## **News Article Fetcher**

This program fetches news articles from the Event Registry API based on specific keywords and saves the results to a JSON file.

### **How It Works**
1. The program uses the provided API key to connect to the Event Registry API.
2. It searches for articles that match the specified keywords.
3. The retrieved articles are saved in a file called `event_registry_data.json`.

### **Requirements**
- Python installed on your system.
- The `requests` and `json` Python libraries.
- An API key from the Event Registry platform.

### **Usage**
1. Replace the placeholder `API_KEY` in the script with your Event Registry API key.
2. Specify the desired keyword(s) in the `params` section of the script.
3. Run the program. If successful:
   - The matching articles will be saved to a file named `event_registry_data.json`.

### **Output**
The program generates a JSON file containing:
- Article titles
- Sources
- Publication dates
- URLs

## Milestone-2
## **LLM.py: Supply Chain Risk and Sentiment Analysis**

### **Overview**
The `LLM.py` script leverages OpenAI's GPT-3.5-Turbo and Hugging Face's transformers library to perform detailed analysis of news articles related to supply chain disruptions. The script focuses on identifying risks and analyzing sentiment to provide actionable insights. It works seamlessly with `fetch_data.py`, which retrieves news articles from the Event Registry API.

### **Features**
1. **Supply Chain Risk Analysis**:
   - Uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5-Turbo model to analyze the body of articles for potential risks in the supply chain.
   - Provides insights into vulnerabilities such as disruptions, resource shortages, geopolitical issues, and economic factors.

2. **Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Uses Hugging Face's `pipeline` for sentiment analysis with the `distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english` model.
   - Determines whether the tone of the article is positive, negative, or neutral.

3. **Integration with `fetch_data.py`**:
   - Processes JSON data generated by the `fetch_data.py` script, enabling seamless integration.
   - Automatically reads and analyzes news articles from `event_registry_data.json`.

4. **Customizable**:
   - Easily adaptable to analyze other types of data or domains by modifying input files or pipeline settings.

### **How It Works**
1. **Input**:
   - Reads articles from a JSON file (`event_registry_data.json`) generated by `fetch_data.py`.
   - Extracts the title and body of each article for analysis.

2. **Analysis**:
   - GPT-3.5-Turbo identifies specific risks mentioned in the article and summarizes them.
   - Sentiment analysis identifies the overall tone of the article.

3. **Output**:
   - Displays risk analysis and sentiment results for each article on the console.

### **Semiconductor Supply Chain Risk Factors**
The script is particularly effective in analyzing risks within semiconductor supply chains. Common risks include:
- **Geopolitical Tensions**: Trade restrictions, embargoes, or conflicts impacting major semiconductor producers (e.g., Taiwan, China).
- **Raw Material Shortages**: Limited availability of critical materials like silicon, rare earth metals, and gallium.
- **Logistics Disruptions**: Delays in shipping, port congestion, and transportation bottlenecks.
- **Economic Factors**: Currency fluctuations, inflation, or shifts in consumer demand.
- **Technological Dependencies**: High reliance on advanced manufacturing technologies concentrated in specific regions.
- **Natural Disasters**: Earthquakes, typhoons, and other events affecting production hubs.
- **Cybersecurity Threats**: Increasing vulnerability of supply chain systems to cyberattacks.
