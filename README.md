# AI-Driven Supply Chain Disruption Predictor and Inventory Optimization System
Overview
This project focuses on developing an AI-powered system to transform supply chain management by predicting disruptions and optimizing inventory levels. The system leverages advanced AI tools, including large language models (e.g., OpenAI GPT, Meta LLaMA), real-time communication platforms, and machine learning to ensure businesses can navigate global uncertainties while improving operational efficiency.
System Features
1.	Global Data Monitoring and Analysis: The system scans news, supplier updates, and transportation trends using NLP to detect risks.
2.	Disruption Prediction: It forecasts supply chain disruptions and assigns risk scores for better planning.
3.	Inventory Optimization: Recommendations for inventory adjustments and reorder points are provided based on risk predictions.
4.	Real-Time Alerts and Dashboards: Critical risks and inventory suggestions are delivered through Slack or Email, along with visual dashboards to assist decision-making.
Expected Outcomes
•	Proactive identification and mitigation of supply chain risks.
•	Improved inventory management with reduced losses and costs.
•	Real-time notifications and actionable insights for better operational planning.
•	Scalable and adaptable functionality for different industries and business sizes.
Technical Requirements
1.	Programming Tools: Python 3.9+, VS Code or PyCharm, Node.js.
2.	Libraries and Frameworks: 
o	NLP: transformers, spacy, nltk.
o	Machine Learning: pytorch or tensorflow, scikit-learn.
o	Data Analysis: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn.
o	API Integrations: openai, google-api-python-client, slack-sdk.
3.	Databases: PostgreSQL or MySQL.
4.	Collaboration Tools: Slack for communication and Git/GitHub for version control.
5.	API Testing: Postman for validating API functionality.
Importance
By enabling businesses to predict and mitigate supply chain risks, this system ensures operational continuity and reduces losses. It’s a critical tool for navigating global challenges like natural disasters, pandemics, or geopolitical tensions.
Key Innovations
•	Utilization of advanced AI models for disruption prediction.
•	Real-time communication tools for timely responses.
•	Seamless ERP integration for inventory management.
Success Metrics
The system’s success will be measured by reduced stockouts, improved inventory efficiency, and minimized supply chain-related losses.
